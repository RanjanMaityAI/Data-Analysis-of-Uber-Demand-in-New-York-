-: Introduction :-

The rapid growth of ride-hailing services like Uber has transformed urban transportation in major cities such as New York. With millions of daily commuters, understanding the factors influencing Uber ride demand is crucial for :

* Service providers (for better resource allocation).
* City planners (for traffic management & urban planning).

This project analyzes Uber pickups in New York over a 6-month period, using a dataset enriched with :

* Weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, snow depth).
* Public holiday information.
* Borough-specific data (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.).
* The dataset contains 29,101 observations across 13 variables, enabling a detailed study of how environmental, temporal, and locational factors affect Uber demand.

-: Objectives :-

* Explore relationships between weather, holidays, boroughs, and Uber pickups.
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including univariate and bivariate analysis.
* Identify key drivers that impact ride requests.
* Generate insights for Uber operations and NYC transportation planning.
